"""rom1.walls.aggdecl - the AGGREGATE-VS-SCALAR DECLARATION sieve.

A two-field destination written at the end of a computation has two models,
and the retail bytes separate them. cl 5.0 lowers a whole-object assignment as
ONE COPY: a load pair off consecutive addresses feeding the two stores. Two
independent scalars are two statements fed by whatever registers produced
them, which the scheduler may separate. So per member displacement pair
(K, K+4) each side reads COPY-shape or SCALAR-shape, and a DISAGREEMENT is a
modelling question in a named direction:

  OVER-AGGREGATED   we copy, retail does not - our source declares one object
                    where retail's declares two scalars
  UNDER-AGGREGATED  retail copies, we do not - the mirror

CGrunt::ClaimSwitchTile 0x52c70 is the worked positive and is the fixture the
`--control` self-test runs: retail stores the two halves straight out of EBX
and EDI with a `mov ecx,esi` BETWEEN them, and the `Coord next` model we had
reloaded the struct's frame home into an adjacent store pair instead.

FOUR THINGS MAKE THE IDENTICAL COPY SHAPE AND ARE NOT AN AGGREGATE. Each was
measured on a function whose two sides are otherwise the same code, and each
cost a false row before it was separated out:

  WALK   the source register is a `*p++` cursor and C2 pre-loaded two steps of
         the walk. CDDrawWorkerHost::ReadPlaneObjects reads its record with one
         `*p++` per member on both sides, and retail pairs the loads at exactly
         one of sixty sites.
  ARG    the source slots are INCOMING STACK ARGUMENTS nothing in the function
         ever wrote. Storing parameter N at member M and parameter N+1 at
         member M+4 is two scalar stores; which parameter lands in which
         register is allocation. StreamFeeder::FeederStart emits the identical
         63 instructions on both sides and the pair reads COPY on one side and
         SEP on the other purely from that rotation.
  COPYF  a frame-sourced copy is also what a SPILL of two scalars looks like:
         cl gives them adjacent slots. ClaimSwitchTile still reads copy-shape
         under the two-scalar model that its own default arm proves correct.
  COPYM  a member-sourced copy is also what `a->x = b->x; a->y = b->y;` looks
         like once the scheduler pairs the loads.

So a row is a LEAD to adjudicate against the disassembly, never a verdict. The
sub-kind is printed to say which adjudication applies.

TWO EXTRACTION BUGS THIS SIEVE IS BUILT AGAINST, both of which produced a
confident one-directional census before they were fixed:

  * the source load must be found by REACHING DEFINITION, not by a fixed
    look-back window. Searching a fixed number of instructions before the FIRST
    store makes the answer depend on where the scheduler put the two loads:
    CBattlezMapConfig::TrackAssignedEnemy emits the identical eight-instruction
    RECT copy on both sides, and a ONE-INSTRUCTION rotation put one load inside
    the window on one side and outside it on the other. That alone accounted
    for 44 of the 55 rows the first sweep reported.
  * the displacement must be UNFOLDED through `lea R,[base+K]`. cl parks
    `obj+0x60` in a register and stores at `[R+0x8]`, which is member 0x68;
    keying on the raw displacement reads one member as two different ones on
    the two sides, and every key on that side shifts at once.

A frame-based destination is dropped rather than compared: the two sides do not
agree on frame offsets. That is walls.storescan's rule and the taint tracking
is shared with it in spirit - a register that received a frame address is a
frame base however it is spelled.

`--reads` runs the READ side of the same question, and it is the more
productive half. A whole-object copy loads BOTH halves before anything is
tested; `a.m_x != X || a.m_y != Y` short-circuits, so cl tests the first half
straight out of memory (`cmp [obj+K],r`) and only touches the second on the
fall-through. Three kinds: PAIR (both halves in registers, no conditional
branch between), SPLIT (a branch separates the touches), MEMOP (a half is
consumed as a memory operand and never loaded). CTriggerMgr::UseToyAt
0x6e120 is the worked positive: one `Coord` copy per compared pair took it
87.70 -> 88.73 and made the whole region instruction-for-instruction retail's.
Calibration on the 100% rows: 1515 comparable keys, 1515 agree, zero rows.
