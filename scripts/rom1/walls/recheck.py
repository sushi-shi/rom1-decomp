"""rom1.walls recheck - re-run a review's certifications against today's pair.

A review that says "base/retail agree on 24 calls, 96 branches and 64 relocs" is
not prose: it is a checkable assertion about the normalized pair.  Nothing
re-ran it.  `CTriggerMgr::PlaceObjectFull` carried exactly that certification
while the base had drifted to 25/95/65 - a later commit traded one cross-jump
for another, the score ROSE, and no source reader could see it because the
review's own numbers were never measured again.

This re-measures every count a review asserts and prints HOLD or BROKEN per
claim.  It reads the same normalized base/target objs `rom1 walls diagnose`
reads, so a BROKEN row is a live divergence, not a stale cache.

The recorded wall CLASS is re-run too, through `diagnose.ladder` itself so the
sweep and the single-row view cannot answer differently.  It is scored
SEPARATELY from the counts and a disagreement is not a failure: the review names
the CAUSE it traced, the ladder names the FIRST divergence, and on this ledger
that vocabulary gap accounts for most disagreements (a regalloc cause whose
branch delta is downstream reads `cfg` here).  A STALE review whose class AND
counts both still hold is a verdict the edit did not invalidate.

    rom1 walls recheck                 every review
    rom1 walls recheck <rva|name>...   selected rows
    rom1 walls recheck --source        the SOURCE notes instead of the ledger
    rom1 walls recheck --broken        only rows with a failed count claim
    rom1 walls recheck --strict        exit 1 when any count claim is broken

There are TWO stores of written verdicts, and `rom1 walls priors` already
reads both: the review ledger and the `//` block above each `RVA()` pin.  Only
the ledger was ever re-measured.  `--source` runs the SAME extractor and the
SAME measurement over the source notes, because a note that says "the frame is
retail's 0x7c" or "313 conditional branches and 1 ret on BOTH sides" is exactly
as checkable, and exactly as unre-run, as a ledger row.  Measured on the first
sweep, 2026-08-23: nine notes stated something the pair no longer holds, four of
them describing a FRAME difference that later work had already closed - a reader
would have gone hunting for a frame that already matches.

`gate_findings` is the same sweep as the `review-claims` row of `rom1 verify
check --tier normal`, so every build re-measures BOTH stores.  Only a BROKEN
claim - the two sides stopped agreeing - reaches the gate; a DRIFT, where they
still agree but not at the stated number, is a retired RULER and is reported by
the verb only.  It belongs in a
tier because it is the drift the MAX gate cannot see: the MAX gate watches the
SCORE, and the commit that broke `PlaceObjectFull`'s certification raised it.

Only AGREEMENT claims are extracted, and deliberately so.  "base 59/retail 43
calls" states a known divergence whose direction depends on the writer's word
order; asserting it back would test the parser, not the tree.  An agreement
claim has one reading: both sides hold N.  Two spellings carry it -

    N/N <unit>                     "2/2 calls", "4/4 DispatchMove calls"
    <agreement trigger> ... N <unit>   "Base/retail agree on 18 calls, 1 return"

- and a sentence that also carries a divergence marker (vs, versus, against,
  differ, while, whereas, short, only) is skipped whole, because those sentences
  mix both kinds and the parser cannot tell which number belongs to which.

`referents` is NOT checked: a review's "ordered referents" is the semdiff
referent SEQUENCE, which is shorter than the relocation count (PlaceObjectFull:
43 referents against 65 relocs), so scoring it against `relocs` would invent a
failure.  Unmatched quantities are reported as such rather than guessed.
