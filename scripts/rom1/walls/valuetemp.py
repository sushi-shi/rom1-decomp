"""rom1.walls.valuetemp - the by-value struct temp sieve.

An inlined accessor returning a two-field struct BY VALUE materialises a frame
temp. The half whose field is READ gets folded into its consumer (cl re-loads
the source member instead), and the UNREAD half's store is emitted and left
dead. Two calls therefore leave two dead stores in adjacent frame slots, fed by
two adjacent member offsets through one base register:

    mov  <rA>,[<b>+N]     mov  <rB>,[<b>+N+4]
    mov  [esp+K],<rA>     mov  [esp+K+4],<rB>       both dead

  target-only   retail takes the pair by value where we read the members -
                give the class the accessor and consume it as an rvalue
                (`Coord LastTilePx() { return m_lastTilePx; }`, used as
                `LastTilePx().m_x`, NOT bound to a named local).
  base-only     the mirror: we copy a pair retail reads in place.

ONLY A MEMBER PAIR IS COMPARABLE. A pair read from another FRAME slot is a local
aggregate copy, and its source offset is a frame offset, which the two sides do
not agree on: RouteToNearbyEnemy emits the identical eleven-instruction RECT
copy on both sides, at [esp+0x6c] on ours and [esp+0x80] on retail's, and keying
on that offset reported it as an asymmetry in BOTH directions at once. Those
pairs are counted and never compared. The base REGISTER is not comparable
either - the two sides put `this` in different registers - so a member pair is
keyed on its member offset alone.

DEAD is decided by the EVENT ORDER on the slot: a store is dead when the next
event on its slot is another store (the RectContains form, where the real value
overwrites the temp) or nothing at all (the GetModeSize form). Three things make
the order the only workable rule.

ESP IS TRACKED, and a CALL RESTORES THE FRAME LEVEL - argument pushes are gone
once it returns. Counting pushes without that drifts the delta upward
monotonically, so one `[esp+0x54]` normalises to five different slots across a
body and the same physical slot before and after a call reads as two.

An ADDRESS-TAKEN aggregate names only its BASE, so a per-dword read scan calls
its interior fields dead; an `lea` observes the whole object it points at, and
it keeps observing it, because the pointer outlives the `lea`.

And a store is only dead against its OWN slot's later events - the RectContains
temp escapes the same slot its successor already killed.

Each row also carries where the POINTER came from, because that is a second cl
5.0 fact: a load through a pointer read from a GLOBAL blocks the dead-store
elimination the same load through a pointer PARAMETER allows. `--global` keeps
only the rows whose pair reaches its member through a global.

`--calibrate` is the negative control this sieve exists to have: it reports the
rows on 100.00% functions, where the two sides ARE the same bytes and any row is
a detector bug. A clean zero from a detector nobody has seen fire is not a
result - `--control` re-proves it against the rows both mechanisms were
established on (the temp on RectContains/RectContainsGated, the global pointer
on SaveScreenshot), and the header line's provenance histogram says how big each
class is, so a `--global` zero is a measurement rather than an empty query.
