"""rom1.walls.inventory - the wall worklist, derived, never hand-kept.

    rom1 walls inventory [--unit U] [--below PCT] [--todo]
                           [--json] [--limit N]

A wall is a function scoring below 100% fuzzy in the CURRENT compare report.
The worklist is a JOIN of three read-only inputs and nothing else:

  * build/objdiff/compare-new/report.json (falling back to
    build/objdiff/report.json) - the current per-function scores;
  * the Model (rom1.model.resolve) - rva/unit/size/channel per name;
  * config/match_baseline.tsv - best_pct (historical MAX) + src_hash per rva.

Campaign order (CLAUDE.md): ascending historical MAX - the lowest bank is
the biggest structural question. cur < best is a REGRESSION flag, not a
wall class; best == 100 with cur < 100 means the implementation already
proved the body and the current dip is TU-state, not structure.

HEADROOM IS `hist` MINUS THE BANK, NEVER `hist` MINUS `cur`, and the two
readings disagree on most rows that look like the biggest prizes in the queue.
`cur` below the BANK is this exact source scoring lower than it already has,
which is TU composition and no action. The BANK below `hist` is a source EDIT
that gave the peak up, so some earlier IMPLEMENTATION reached a mark nothing
in the tree now reproduces - that, and only that, is a question. Measured
2026-08-23 over the 578-row todo queue: 66 rows have hist above cur and 20 of
them are the first kind. `CGruntSelectedSprite::Update` reads as the biggest
opportunity in the whole queue at cur 84.85 against hist 99.24, and its bank
is also 99.24 - that source already reached the peak and there is nothing to
do. The `L` flag marks the 46 that are real; the deepest is
`CDDrawSurfaceMgr::SnapshotChildren`, banked at 70.12 against a 77.52 peak.

An `L` row is a question, not a promise, so read `walls priors` before working
one: some of these peaks were given up DELIBERATELY, because the shape that
scored them is refuted by retail's own bytes. `CSBI_ImageSet::SetupImage`
(bank 68.31, hist 74.63) is exactly that - the 74.63 spelling tested `owner`
before `host`, and retail tests `[esp+0xc]`, the second parameter, first.
Recovering that number would mean re-introducing a wrong guard order.

The report also scores the carved EH band (`__ehreg$*` / `__ehunwind$*`),
which rom1.verify.scores excludes from the gate because those funclets are
not reconstruction targets. They are KEPT here (they are real sub-100 rows)
but counted separately in the header, so the worklist total is never read as
a body count.

``--todo`` is Codex's explicit campaign queue.  It removes EH-band funclets,
functions already proven exact historically, and only those functions Codex
personally recorded as ``bounded`` or ``exact`` at the current source hash.
Inherited ``@early-stop`` markers do not affect it.  Hash-valid ``open``
reviews remain in the queue with their recorded class and next evidence-bearing
action.
