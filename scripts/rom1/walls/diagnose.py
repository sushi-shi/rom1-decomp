"""rom1.walls.diagnose - classify one wall from the normalized pair.

    rom1 walls diagnose <rva|mangled|CClass::Member> [--asm]

The ladder (CLAUDE.md): the FIRST divergence class decides the wall.

  referent   masked instruction bytes identical, only relocation TARGETS
             differ - an identity/aliasing question, not codegen. Lever:
             the reloc-sequence diff below; fix the claim, not the source.
  inline     the call-target multisets differ - a callee was expanded on
             one side and called on the other (or a call-set member is
             missing). Lever: `rom1 walls inline-model --gap` quantifies
             the budget deficit; docs/patterns/ob1-budget-cutoff-*,
             inline-visibility-splits-call-and-expansion.md.
  cfg        call sets agree but branch/return counts differ - control-flow
             reconstruction (arm shape, tail merge, loop form). Levers:
             docs/patterns/ tail/cross-jump/do-while family.
  regalloc   same calls, same branch skeleton, different bytes - register
             allocation / scheduling / instruction selection. Lever:
             docs/relevations/cl5-callcrossing-ebx-first-by-use-schedule.md;
             a TU-state probe (docs/patterns/tu-state-probe-family-*) as a
             disposable A/B only.

A `prior:` line follows the class when `config/codex_wall_reviews.tsv` already
holds a verdict for the row.  The two labels answer DIFFERENT questions and it
matters when they disagree: this tool names the FIRST divergence, so any branch
or return delta reads `cfg`, while a reviewer names the CAUSE they traced it to.
On 8 of the queue's 53 review-only rows that cause is register allocation with
the branch delta downstream of it - `CGruntPuddle`'s review says it outright
("the automatic CFG label is downstream codegen").  Without the line a matcher
reads "CFG - a structural reconstruction question" and hunts a source shape the
review already disproved.  The class above is still what the bytes say; the
`prior:` line only says who else has looked.

Inputs, read-only: the Model (locate the function), the compare out-dir's
NORMALIZED base/target objs (delink.coffx topology), tool.objdump for the
instruction skeleton. No retail-image reads here: the pair IS the evidence
objdiff scored.
