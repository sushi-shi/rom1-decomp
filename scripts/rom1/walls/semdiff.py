"""rom1.walls.semdiff - OPERAND-LEVEL adjudication of a normalized pair.

`walls diagnose` CLASSIFIES a wall (referent -> inline/call-set -> cfg ->
regalloc). It does not ADJUDICATE it: its call-set and branch-skeleton view
cannot see a member read at the wrong displacement, a swapped store source,
a dropped `fild`, or a mask that lost a bit. Those are the live-bug classes,
and they are all multiset questions over the two sides' operands.

This module answers them. It reads the same evidence objdiff scored (the
normalized pair under build/objdiff/compare-new) and compares, as multisets:

    fp      FP opcode counts        cl NEVER adds or drops a conversion to
                                    schedule - any delta is semantic
    disp    member displacements    [reg+N] with reg != esp: the fields the
                                    function actually reads and writes
    store   store targets           the displacement side of `mov [reg+N],x`
    imm     immediates              constants, masks, magic numbers
    mnem    mnemonic counts         the coarse shape, printed last

The EXCLUSIVE section is printed FIRST and is the whole point: a key one side
uses and the other never touches. `b3/t4` on a shared key is almost always
scheduling; `b0/t2` is a constant, offset or conversion that exists on one
side only, and that is where the four bugs of 2026-08-20 were found.

Two more sections cover what a value-level multiset structurally cannot see,
because objdiff MASKS relocated operands:

    referent sequence   the ORDERED list of relocation targets. A swapped
                        pair of string keys, or a global bound to the wrong
                        symbol, is invisible in the scored bytes and obvious
                        here.
    cmd/key pairing     the ordered (pushed small immediate -> string
                        referent) pairs: "which widget got which command id
                        and which sprite key", which neither the value
                        multiset nor the referent order decides alone.

FALSE-POSITIVE TAXONOMY. Every one of these was observed producing a
difference on a pair whose semantics are identical; the filters that can be
applied mechanically are applied, the rest are for the reader:

  * register mirrors        `cmp a,b/jge` == `cmp b,a/jle`; `and al,0xe0` ==
                            `and ecx,0xffffffe0` (cl uses the 2-byte AL form
                            when the value lands in EAX); `cdq` == `sar 31`
                            for the signed-modulo sign mask. FILTERED: no.
  * cross-jump merge degree one side shares a cleanup/call site the other
                            duplicates. Changes call-SITE counts, never the
                            set of paths that reach the call. FILTERED: no.
  * lea-folded displacement retail `lea eax,[base+0x150]` then `[eax+0x24]`
                            vs ours `[base+0x174]` - the same address, the
                            array base folded into the member offset.
                            FILTERED: no (compare the SUM).
  * operand width           a byte store read back as a dword when the upper
                            bytes are known zero. FILTERED: no.
  * rep-stos first-dword    a `memset` whose first element is stored
                            separately from the `rep stos` tail.
  * RMW split/fold          `add [m],1` vs `mov r,[m]; inc r; mov [m],r`
                            changes the disp count for one member.
  * FP-stack housekeeping   `fmulp` vs `fmul st,st(1)` + a later `fstp` -
                            the POP discipline, not a conversion. fld/fstp
                            deltas are noise; fild/fistp deltas are not.
  * jump-table data         a function's own index/target table decodes as
                            junk instructions with huge displacements.
                            FILTERED: yes - every line whose referent is the
                            function itself is dropped.
  * byte-continuation       the second line of a long instruction carries
                            bytes and no mnemonic. FILTERED: yes.
  * frame-size immediates   `sub esp,N` / `add esp,N` / `ret N` are the
                            local-slot count and the callee cleanup, never
                            semantics. FILTERED: yes.
  * one-past-end referent   `sym+size` aliases the NEXT symbol's name, so
                            one side reads `foo+0x400` and the other
                            `bar+1` for the same address. FILTERED: no.

    rom1 walls semdiff <rva|name> [--top N] [--all]
    rom1 walls semsweep <tsv> [--first N] [--last N] [--fp-only]

semsweep screens a worklist (the `walls inventory` TSV shape: unit, name,
rva, pct, size, class, detail) and prints ONE line per row unless the row has
an exclusive key or an FP delta - the shape that made a 379-row lane
tractable in one pass.
