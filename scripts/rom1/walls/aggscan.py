"""rom1.walls.aggscan - the BY-VALUE AGGREGATE ARGUMENT sieve.

cl 5.0 hands an aggregate wider than a register by opening a hole in the
outgoing frame and copying into it:

    lea  edi,[obj+0x134]
    sub  esp,0x10
    mov  ebx,esp
    mov  ecx,[edi]      / mov [ebx],ecx        (four dword copies)
    ...
    call callee

Four `push`es of four separate `i32` is a DIFFERENT shape. So the hole is a
one-instruction witness that the callee's parameter at that position is ONE
16-byte object, and a declaration that spells it `i32 x, i32 y, i32 w, i32 h`
is wrong about the source even when the call site happens to score well -
`AddToList3` took the level record's rect as four ints named `player0..3` and
retail's site built one block.

WHAT IT ASKS. Not "do the two sides look the same here" - that is the score's
question and it drowns in scheduling. It aggregates {callee -> hole sizes}
over the WHOLE image on both sides and asks a signature question of every call
site at once: is there a callee retail hands a block and we never do?

TWO ATTRIBUTION RULES, both measured rather than assumed:

  * the `mov reg,esp` is looked for up to the NEXT CALL, not inside a fixed
    byte window. cl interleaves the copies of consecutive holes, so
    `sub esp,0x10 / ... / mov edx,esp` can be 22 bytes apart; a 16-byte window
    found ONE hole in a region where the disassembly has four, and called
    three sites missing that our own object emits.
  * an unconditional `jmp` is FOLLOWED. cl tail-merges the argument build -
    several predecessors each fill a hole and jump to one shared call - so
    stopping at the first `call` BYTE attributes the block to whatever call
    sits next in layout order. It named `CTriggerMgr::CellDispatch` for two
    blocks that in fact jump to `CGrunt::PlaySound`.

AND ONE SOUNDNESS FILTER: a reservation whose size is not a multiple of 4 is
rejected. The scan reads bytes rather than a decoded stream, so `83 EC 02`
appears inside the displacement of `mov DWORD PTR [ebx+0x2ec],0x1f401`; cl
never moves ESP by a non-dword amount, so the filter costs nothing and removes
that whole class.

WHAT IS COUNTED APART: a reservation nothing is COPIED INTO is the frame,
which is `framescan`'s channel and not an argument. That test is structural
rather than positional - "the first reservation is the frame" both dropped six
real callees whose only block sits in the prologue and, on
`CGrunt::StepDefenderBehavior`, charged a 104-vs-92-byte frame delta to
`CUserLogic::GetScreenPos`, whose parameter is a pointer.

WHAT THE SWEEP IS WORTH, measured 2026-08-23: 179 argument holes ours against
182 retail, over 20 distinct callees. ZERO callees are retail-only and ZERO are
ours-only - there is no function in the tree that takes scalars where retail
takes an aggregate, or the reverse - and every named callee's hole-SIZE
multiset matches exactly. Two functions differ, both in the COUNT of holes at
one size (`CGrunt::StepGruntMovement` 2 vs 6, the tail-merged 12-byte
`GruntDirectionCell`; `CStatusBarMgr::BuildTabzDialog` 15 vs 14), which is an
inlining or block-layout divergence, not a signature. The retail-only /
ours-only verdict held under BOTH the earlier positional frame rule and this
one, so it does not rest on the filter.
