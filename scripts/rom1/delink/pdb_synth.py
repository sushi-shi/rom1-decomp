"""rom1.delink.pdb_synth - synthesize the delinker's named PDB from the Model.

No retail PDB is available for RoM1 (1998); this builds one good enough for
vostok-delinker to slice ALLODS.EXE into per-unit COFF objects:

  1. Function records from the Model's function bindings: the claimed name (or
     a FUN_<va> placeholder), the claim-resolved extent, and the owning unit as
     a synthetic `c:\\proj\\<unit>.c` source file (C13 line info) so the
     delinker emits one `<unit>.c.obj` per TU. kind=pad rows are never emitted;
     kind=eh rows are superseded by the per-owner EH-band records
     (rom1.delink.eh_band). ILT/import thunks inherit the body/import name so
     relocations pair by name on both sides.
  2. Data records for every relocation-target address (S_LDATA32), renamed to
     the claimed source names and cl's own `??_C@` string-pool spellings (the
     base objs are the oracle), plus the proven `__imp_` IAT decorations.
     Every identity is PROVIDED, never invented: a target no name reaches
     keeps a fence whose spelling states the verdict of the referencing-band
     split - `DAT_<va>` when only library bands reference it (a deliberate
     synthetic), `UNPROVISIONED_<va>` when any game band does (a defect the
     delinker refuses to emit).
  3. `llvm-pdbutil yaml2pdb`, then the DBI-header byte-patch: yaml2pdb cannot
     emit a GSI symbol-records stream and pdb2's `global_symbols()` errors on a
     nil index, so the header is repointed at an existing empty stream.
