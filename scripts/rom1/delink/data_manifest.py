"""rom1.delink.data_manifest - vostok's `--data-manifest` + section manifest.

The reviewed-data-topology delinker emits each claimed global and each `??_C@`
string literal as a real named definition in its owning target object (right
storage class + alignment, interior base relocations converted to COFF
relocations, references to it becoming EXTERNALS). The companion SECTION
manifest additionally rebuilds those definitions in the CANDIDATE's section
shape: objdiff scores data all-or-nothing per SECTION, so a packed target
section can never reach 100.0 even with every payload present.

Schemas (read out of the delinker binary; the data manifest takes 9 or 10
columns):
    name  object  rva  size  storage  alignment  [section_ordinal]
        section_offset  scope  provenance
    object  ordinal  name  rva  size  alignment  characteristics
        comdat_selection  associative_ordinal  storage  provenance
`section_ordinal = -` selects the legacy reviewed-allocation form; ordinals
are per-object and must be CONTIGUOUS FROM ONE.

Inputs (the Model replaces the old tree's symbol_names.csv):
  * Model.data claimed bindings - names, units, model-resolved extents; the
    retail PE classifies each row's storage;
  * the base objs (build/objdiff/base) - cl's own string/vtable/RTTI COMDATs,
    section topology, FP pools;
  * the Model's data_vtables/data_static_libs bindings (winners AND aliases)
    - the reviewed ??_7 name -> (rva, slots) authority.

Evidence rules (never fabricate an extent): an extent is the claim-stated
size or the admitted census's derived boundary span, never guessed; an
overlap withholds BOTH sides and reports; an extent crossing a storage
boundary is withheld. Mechanisms ported from the old tree's
build/data_manifest.py (see its docstrings for the measured history).
