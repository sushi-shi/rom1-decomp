"""rom1.verify.link_tier - the candidate-EXE audits (link tier, opt-in).

Needs `rom1 link`'s outputs (ALLODS.candidate.EXE + .map). Three ported
checks folded into one tier module:

  LINK DEFECTS   the link must be REAL: 0 unresolved externals (the linker's
                 own unresolved.txt), and a pre-link closure over the base
                 objs - every undefined external resolves from a base obj
                 definition/COMMON/weak-alias, a toolchain .LIB, or an
                 import. A symbol none of those supply is a guaranteed
                 `unresolved external symbol` (the declared-only family).
  SECTION CENSUS the candidate's section table vs retail's - per-section raw
                 sizes and deltas (the link-order study's byte budget); a
                 section retail has that the candidate lacks is FATAL.
  IMAGE DIFF     for every claimed function the compare report scores at
                 100%, the candidate's bytes at its LINK-ASSIGNED rva (the
                 .map) must equal retail's at the retail rva under reloc
                 masking (the retail manifest's exact per-body DIR32 offsets
                 blanked on both sides). The linked-image check is what
                 objdiff's per-obj scoring cannot see: final placement.

    rom1 verify link-tier             # the three checks, exit 1 on any
    rom1 verify link-tier --census    # the section table only
