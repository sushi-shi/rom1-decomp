"""rom1.verify.data_access - the RETAIL-side data-access audit (full tier).

The instrument for the question the match score structurally cannot answer.
We choose the extent of every datum we claim, so a too-small claim ALWAYS
scores 100: objdiff only compares what we told it to compare. This gate works
from RETAIL's side - which bytes does retail's code touch, and how wide - so a
silently unmodelled field, a wrong width, a too-small array COUNT or a phantom
object shows up as a disagreement between what retail does and what we
declared.

Engine + schema: rom1.verify.access_map (retail bytes and recovered DIR32 from
sema.image, decode from tool.objdump, the claim spine from the Model, the
declared field layout from verify.layout). Artifacts:
build/gen/data_access_map.sqlite (the query index) and
build/gen/data_access_map.tsv (the grep-able access table).

CATEGORIES
  unclaimed   retail touches bytes no claim covers -> unmodelled data
  unaccessed  a claim nothing in the image references -> phantom candidate
  width       access width/kind disagrees with the declared field -> wrong type
  stride      an index scale inside a claim disagrees with its element size
  undercount  a claim declared with ONE element is INDEXED -> under-declared
              COUNT or a false split of a larger object
  shortfall   an array whose own walker over-runs the declared end -> too-small
              forward storage; SHIFTS its section (never byte-neutral)
  adjacent    two claims reached through ONE base register -> one object
  import-slot a source claim on an address retail CALLS indirectly through the
              IAT -> the pin models an import thunk slot as a game global

WHAT IS GATED. Only categories whose suppression set is RE-PROVEN on this tree
(see `--calibrate`: the control set is claims whose data section objdiff scores
at exactly 100.0, whose declared type resolves, and that retail accesses) are
allowed to fail the build; the rest report. `GATED` and `REPORT_ONLY` below
carry the measured rate and the reason, one line each.

    CONTROL SET: claims that live in a data section objdiff scores at exactly
    100.0, whose declared type fully resolves, and that retail actually
    accesses. Those bytes are byte-identical to retail, so nothing about their
    CONTENT can be wrong.

    What that does and does NOT prove, stated precisely, because getting this
    wrong is how a sieve gets believed:
      * It does NOT make a `width` finding a false positive. A section at 100.0
        means the BYTES match; the declared TYPE can still be wrong, and that is
        the entire premise of this map. So every control-set finding has to be
        ADJUDICATED against the retail disassembly by hand - the number below is
        a FLAG RATE, and the report states the adjudicated split.
      * It DOES bound the noise: a sieve that flags a large fraction of
        byte-exact, fully-typed claims is measuring its own bugs.

    `unclaimed` is reported separately and split by whether the run begins
    exactly at a control claim's END (an extent claim about that claim) or
    somewhere else, because attributing an unclaimed run to the nearest
