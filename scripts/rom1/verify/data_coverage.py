"""rom1.verify.data_coverage - is every datum MODELLED, not merely byte-equal?

The other half of the data-access audit, asked from OUR side. We choose the
extent, so a TOO-SMALL claim always scores 100: model `float g_v` where retail
has `struct { float x, y; }` and objdiff compares four bytes, finds them equal
and calls the section exact. This module reports which retail bytes NO enrolled
datum covers, and what retail's own payload says about them.

NEITHER SIDE ALONE TELLS PADDING FROM AN UNMODELLED FIELD - an uncovered byte
retail READS is unmodelled data, an uncovered byte nothing ever touches is
padding - so every row here carries the access map's verdict for the same
range (`touched`/`sites`, from rom1.verify.data_access's sweep).

THE ORACLES, ALL FROM RETAIL, NONE FROM OUR PAYLOAD
  claims   the MODEL's named data bindings (rva + extent + owner) - every
           datum this tree claims, initialized or not. The frozen tool used
           the delink manifest alone, which predates the census: a `.bss`
           global that no object carves is claimed but never enrolled, so the
           manifest-only reading reported thousands of modelled globals as
           uncovered.
  enrolled build/gen/delink_data_manifest.tsv - the subset objdiff compares.
  sections build/gen/delink_data_section_manifest.tsv - a PLACED candidate
           section rebuilds (and objdiff compares) bytes no datum names: a /GR
           vtable COMDAT carries the ??_R4 pointer 4 bytes in front of `??_7`.
           Counting those as uncovered manufactured ~180 false positives along
           the vtable frontier alone in the frozen tool.
  payload  retail's bytes at an uncovered range. cl's inter-symbol padding is
           ZERO, so a NON-ZERO uncovered byte is content nobody modelled.
  .reloc   a relocated word INSIDE an uncovered range is a POINTER nobody
           modelled - conclusive, and it cannot be alignment padding; and the
           stored addresses give the set of addresses the image POINTS AT.

ADJACENCY PROVES NOTHING. A gap is reported, never closed by inventing an
aggregate to fill it.

VERDICTS
  PAD          uncovered, all-zero, shorter than 8 B. cl's own inter-symbol
               padding. Benign; the calibration floor.
  ZERO-GAP     uncovered, all-zero, too long to be padding.
  NONZERO      uncovered bytes that are not zero. Content nobody modelled.
  POINTER      NONZERO and retail relocates a word inside it - unmodelled
               pointer data, conclusive.
  OVERLAP      two claims covering one byte with different extents (a folded
               COMDAT seen from N objects agrees on both and is excluded).
