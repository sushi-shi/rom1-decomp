"""rom1.verify.classify - the rva-keyed regression computation.

IDENTITY IS THE RVA, NOT THE NAME OR THE UNIT. A best-ever measures a BODY;
the name is only our label for it, and labels get reassigned (a fold renames a
method, a COMDAT re-home moves it between units). The Model
(rom1.model.resolve) is the one rva/unit/name join - no label re-joins here.

Bucket doctrine (ported):
  * BELOW-BEST IS TESTED FIRST - an edited function's drop below its own
    high-water is still a REGRESS; TOUCHED means "edited and NOT below best".
  * a vanished (unit, fn) whose rva is scored under a new key is MOVED (cross
    unit) or RENAMED (in place), gated against the same body's best there.
  * a vanished row whose rva is no longer scored at all is LOST - unless its
    baseline row is already banked `state=absent` (KNOWN-ABSENT: the loss was
    adjudicated and banked; the MAX is preserved for a later emitter).
  * REGRESS splits into carried (the committed snapshot ALREADY had the row
    below its best - inherited debt) and fresh (new since the snapshot - the
    set a lane is actually answerable for).
