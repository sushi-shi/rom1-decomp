"""rom1.verify.library_overlap - no src claim on a static-libs row (normal).

ALLODS.EXE statically links MFC + CRT; library code is never hand-
reconstructed - it gets a functions_static_libs.tsv / data_static_libs.tsv
row and game code calls it through the real headers. A retail RVA is
therefore a src RECONSTRUCTION xor a library CARVE-OUT (the vendored zlib
channel is the deliberate coexistence and lives in its own tables).

The Model's precedence quietly ALIASES a static-libs label under a winning
src claim; this gate makes that loud (the merged verify_library_overlap
verdict): every binding whose winner is a src channel and whose alias set
carries a static-libs claim is a double-claim - prune the false table row,
or carve the hand-copied library body out of src/.

LOW-confidence static-lib rows are leads, not claims (model policy filters
them before resolution), so they cannot alias and are NOT findings here -
that narrowing vs the frozen gate is deliberate and recorded.
