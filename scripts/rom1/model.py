"""rom1.model - the one join: census rows x provider claims -> bindings.

    rom1 model            resolve, write build/gen/bindings.tsv +
                            violations.tsv (both write-if-changed - the
                            bindings file is the delink key), print a summary

THE RULE: functions.tsv / data.tsv contribute ONLY structure - starts, kinds,
derived extents. Every identity (name, unit, exact matched size) comes from a
channel: the extracted source claims (RVA/DATA/RVA_COMPGEN/RVA_DYNINIT/
DATA_COMPGEN) and the committed provider tables. A claim whose rva is not an
admitted census row is a violation; a claim size may never cross the next
admitted start.

Resolution policy (this module is the ONLY place policy lives):
  * LOW-confidence static-lib rows are leads, not claims - filtered here;
  * channel precedence per rva: src > src_compgen > src_dyninit >
    src_data_compgen > functions_zlib/data_zlib > data_vtables >
    data_runtime_classes > data_compgen > data_static_libs >
    functions_static_libs; later claims on the same rva become recorded
    ALIASES, never silent losers;
  * function extent = claimed size when the winning channel states one
    (src / zlib), else the census-derived extent;
  * kind compatibility: func claims bind kind ''|helper (static-lib labels
    also thunk - retail interleaves are real); data claims must match their
    census kind where the channel implies one (vtable/rtti/common/copy).

    hold a body is not a source fact: cl emits the COMDAT only where the
    inline is odr-used, and the retail linker picked one of exactly those
    copies. So the emitting set is read here, from the units' own objects,

    is given. Data claims are main-file-only (a `DATA()` in a header is a
    FATAL of its own) and never multi-unit, so only functions are filtered.

    A claim no object defines survives unfiltered - the label is real evidence
    about retail either way - and is reported once as the modelling gap it is.

    WHY HERE and not in delink/pdb_synth (asked and settled): `unit` is read
    by sema, walls, verify and the exe-map as well as the delinker, and all of
    them take a Model - deciding the owner downstream would leave every other
    consumer looking at the alphabetical tie-break. Ownership of a multiply
    emitted inline is inherently a materialization fact, so SOME object read
    is unavoidable; this is the module whose docstring already says policy
    lives here. Unlike the per-claim authority check it replaced, it only
