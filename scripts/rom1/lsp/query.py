"""rom1.lsp.query - the refs / hover verbs (and the index builder).

A target is either `file:line[:col]` (1-based, as grep/editors print) or a
symbol name. Symbols go through clangd's workspace-symbol index: `CGrunt`
matches the class, `CGrunt::GetAI` the qualified member; an ambiguous query
lists every candidate and exits rather than guessing. Cross-TU reference
answers come from the background index (build/clangd/.cache/) - early runs on
a cold cache may be partial; `rom1 lsp index` warms it.

A target that LOOKS like a point (`path:line`) but names no readable file is
reported as the missing file it is - never re-tried as a symbol, which used to
answer 'no workspace symbol matches include/Foo.h:12'.
