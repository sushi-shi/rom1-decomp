"""rom1.graph - the one build graph, and the verbs that drive it.

`python3 -m rom1.graph` (configure) writes **build/build.ninja** from
config/units.toml; `ninja -f build/build.ninja` from the repo root then runs
the whole loop:

    src/ --cl--> base objs --labels--> claims --model--> bindings
                                                      --delink--> target objs
    base objs + target objs --normalize--> comparison copies
                            --project--> objdiff.json --report--> report.json

Every edge invokes an existing module's own CLI (`python3 -m rom1.tool.cl`,
`rom1.retail_labels.source`, `rom1.model`, `rom1.delink.run`,
`rom1.compare.{normalize,project}`, `rom1.tool.objdiff`); this package
owns only the WIRING, plus the two things a graph needs that no module
provides: the `cl` edge driver (rom1.graph.cc) and the candidate-link
policy (rom1.graph.link).

The manifest lives under build/ rather than at the repo root because it is
generated state; ninja's build root stays the repo root, so every path in it
is repo-relative and `ninja -f build/build.ninja` is run from the top.

Incrementality rests on one rule: EVERY producer writes if-changed, and its
rule carries `restat`. An edit that does not change an artifact's content
therefore stops the cascade exactly there - a code-only edit reaches
normalize/report without re-delinking, and a no-op build does nothing.
