"""rom1.graph.cc - the `cl` edge driver: compile, stabilise, write-if-changed.

    python3 -m rom1.graph.cc --out <obj> --src <src> [--unit U] -- <cl flags>

rom1.tool.cl runs the compiler (and already owns the wine plumbing: the
persistent wineserver, the temp-FILE capture and process-group kill that keep
an unreaped grandchild from wedging ninja's pipe, and "the produced .obj is
the success signal, never the return code"). This module is what makes the
EDGE incremental, which needs two more things cl 5.0 does not give:

  * cl stamps every COFF header with the wall-clock TimeDateStamp, so two
    compiles of one unchanged TU differ in bytes 4..7 AND NOWHERE ELSE
    (measured on this toolchain). Left alone, every rebuild dirties every
    object and everything downstream of it re-runs for no reason.
  * ninja prunes a subtree only when an output's mtime does not move, so an
    object whose content did not change must not be rewritten at all.

So: compile into `<base-dir>/.tmp/`, compare against the installed object
with the TimeDateStamp field masked out, and install only on a real
difference - zeroing the stamp on the way in, so objects converge to
byte-reproducible content. With `restat = 1` on the `cl` rule that makes an
unchanged recompile a genuine no-op for labels / normalize / report.

Zeroing is matching-NEUTRAL: TimeDateStamp is COFF header metadata, lives in
no section, is named by no relocation, and neither objdiff, the delinker nor
link.exe reads it. The temp directory is a dotted subdirectory of the object
tree on purpose - the model's `build/objdiff/base` readers glob `*.obj`, and
a sibling temp file would enrol into the data manifest as a phantom unit.

Both scratch paths are per-PROCESS. Two `rom1 build` runs in one tree (an
orchestrator and a matcher, two agents, a rebuild started while the last one
still ran) are not serialised by anything - ninja takes no lock - and both
scratch names used to be shared:

  * a shared `.tmp/<unit>.obj` let one run's `cl.compile()` unlink the other's
    finished object before its `install()` read it, which surfaced as "cl
    produced no object (rc=0)" with an EMPTY diagnostic - the compiler blamed
    for a collision - and as a FileNotFoundError traceback out of the rename;
  * a shared `<unit>.obj.install` is worse, because it makes the rename stop
    being atomic ACROSS processes: A can `os.replace` the temp while B is
    still writing its own bytes into it, so the object PUBLISHED under a valid
    name is a prefix of B's payload. Observed once in this tree -
    rom1.compare.normalize failed a real build with "COFF string table is
    not final" and a census found exactly one invalid object - and transient,
    since the next write repaired it.

`install()` additionally refuses a payload that is not a complete COFF. That
covers the other way an incomplete object reaches the tree (a cl killed
mid-write, a full disk), which nothing checked before: the edge must FAIL, not
enrol a short object that labels, the delink manifests and normalize then read.
