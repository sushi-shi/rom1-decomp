"""rom1.graph.emit - configure: config/units.toml -> build/build.ninja.

    python3 -m rom1.graph            # (re)write build/build.ninja
    ninja -f build/build.ninja         # run the loop, from the repo root

The rules, in the order the loop runs them. The first nine plus the two
`verify` edges are the DEFAULT target; `rc`/`link` are phase 2, opt-in:

    configure   the generator edge - re-emits this manifest when the unit
                census, the emitter, or ANY file the include scan read changes
    cl          source -> build/objdiff/base/<unit>.obj   (rom1.graph.cc)
    compdb      units.toml -> build/clangd/compile_commands.json - the clang-cl
                flags extraction and the LSP consumers ride (rom1.graph.compdb)
    labels      source + headers + base obj -> build/gen/claims/<unit>.tsv
    model       claims x censuses/providers -> build/gen/bindings.tsv
    delink      bindings -> build/objdiff/target-new/<unit>.c.obj
    normalize   base + target objs -> the comparison copies
    project     the delinked directory -> compare-new/objdiff.json
    report      comparison copies + pairing -> compare-new/report.json
    verify_fp   sources x bindings -> the per-function fingerprint cache
    verify_check the MAX gate + the fast+normal tiers -> a stamp; FATAL
    rc / link   PHASE 2, opt-in (`ninja candidate`): base objs + .res ->
                the candidate image + .map for the link-order study

Two edges declare a STAMP rather than their real outputs, because neither set
can be enumerated at configure time: `delink` writes one object per unit that
has a claim (a unit with none writes nothing, so declaring every unit would
leave ninja re-running the whole delink on every build), and `normalize`
writes a variable pair of copies per unit. Both drivers are keyed on content
upstream, so the stamp only moves when something real did.

Restat is on `cl`, `compdb`, `labels`, `model` and `project` - the producers
that write if-changed. That is the whole incrementality story: a pure code
edit re-runs configure (every source is in the include scan's own dep set) +
cl + labels, stops at an unchanged claim fragment, and reaches the report
without re-delinking; a label edit carries on through model, delink and the
pairing. Labels declare the same per-TU header closure as `cl`: extraction
reads inline `RVA` annotations from headers even when MSVC emits no changed
bytes, so the object edge's `restat` cannot be allowed to hide a renamed claim.

`verify_fp` also carries restat, but MEASURED its producer rewrites the cache
unconditionally (identical bytes, fresh mtime), so the restat is inert there
and `verify_check` re-runs after any source edit.

The era toolchain ($MSVC_DIR/$DXSDK_DIR) and the vostok-delinker binary are
environment rather than files under the repo, so they are declared INDIRECTLY:
`toolchain_id()` renders all three into build/gen/toolchain.id (write-if-changed),
and the cl, compdb and delink edges list that file. A re-pin therefore
invalidates exactly the edges it should. This is not cosmetic - before it, a
toolchain swap recompiled only the units that happened to be dirty and left the
rest built by the previous cl, which for a byte-matching project is the worst
possible failure, and a delinker swap gave `ninja: no work to do`.
