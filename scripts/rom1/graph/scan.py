"""rom1.graph.scan - repo-local `#include` deps for the `cl` edges.

The `cl` rule lists only the .cpp as its input, so without the headers as
implicit deps a header-only edit (a struct-offset fix in a shared .h) does not
rebuild the dependent object, and the next diff is read off STALE code. MSVC
5.0 rejects `/showIncludes` (D4002), so cl can emit no depfile and the scan is
what we have.

That makes the dep lists CONFIGURE-TIME facts, baked from the include graph as
it stood. Any edit that changes that graph - a new `#include`, a renamed or
deleted header - invalidates them silently. `scanned()` therefore returns
every repo-local file the scan READ, and the generator edge depends on the
whole set: the scan invalidates itself.

Resolution mirrors cl's own search: a quoted include relative to the including
file's directory first (the `All-aggregated.cpp` pattern pulls sibling .cpp
files that way), then the `include/` tree that rom1.tool.cl puts on `/I`.
System headers resolve to nothing under the repo and are skipped - the MSVC
and DX SDK headers are pinned by the toolchain and never change under a build.
