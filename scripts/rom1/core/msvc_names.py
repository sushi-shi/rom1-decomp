"""rom1.core.msvc_names - one spelling for one cl 5.0 symbol.

Two directions over the same vocabulary:

  * FORWARD (labelling). clang proposes a mangled name; cl 5.0's own spelling
    for the same declaration is a DETERMINISTIC function of that name plus the
    declaration's linkage, so `func`/`data` derive it from SOURCE alone - no
    object is read, and a stale build artifact can no longer answer for source
    that has changed. Three rules, each measured over the whole claim corpus
    (`rom1 verify selftest -k SourceNameRewrite` re-proves them per build):
      1. the i386 COFF global prefix - LLVM adds `_` to every name that is not
         already MSVC-mangled (`?...`); the IR value name lacks it, libclang's
         `mangledName` already carries it;
      2. array storage class - clang spells a top-level array `@@<d>Q` (const
         pointer), cl 5.0 `@@<d>P`;
      3. TU-local storage - cl's `outdname` wraps a datum with no external
         linkage as `_<mangled>$S<n>`; the `<n>` is dropped (see MASK).

  * MASK (joining). cl stamps a per-object CodeView counter onto every TU-local
    datum (`name$S<n>`) and numbers a function-local static's enclosing lexical
    scope (`@?<n>??`, `<n>` counting every scope c1 opened). Both renumber on
    any edit to the translation unit, so neither is ever stored: `mask` reduces
    EITHER side of a name join to the ordinal-free form, which is what makes a
    canonical claim and cl's own object symbol meet.

`discriminate` is the one sanctioned way back to a unique spelling: several
translation units can hold a same-named TU-local static, and the delink data
manifest needs one name per address image-wide. The retail rva is the
discriminator - the convention cl-generated data already uses (`$T<rva>` FP
pool slots), and `mask` folds it straight back onto the family.
